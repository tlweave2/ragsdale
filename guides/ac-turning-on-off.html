<h1>Why Does My Air Conditioner Keep Turning On and Off?</h1>

<p>If your air conditioner is short cycling (turning on and off frequently), it's not just annoying—it can lead to higher energy bills, reduced comfort, and expensive repairs. This common problem has several causes, and understanding them can help you know when to call for professional help.</p>

<h2>Common Causes of AC Short Cycling</h2>

<h3>1. Dirty Air Filter</h3>
<p>The most common and easily fixable cause. A clogged filter restricts airflow, causing the system to overheat and shut down. In Central Valley's dusty climate, filters need checking monthly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace or clean your filter every 1-3 months.</p>

<h3>2. Refrigerant Leak</h3>
<p>Low refrigerant levels cause pressure imbalances that trigger safety switches, shutting the system down prematurely.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> This requires professional repair—refrigerant leaks must be fixed and recharged by licensed technicians.</p>

<h3>3. Oversized AC Unit</h3>
<p>An air conditioner that's too large for your home cools too quickly and shuts off before completing a full cycle, never properly dehumidifying your home.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> May require replacing with a properly sized system.</p>

<h3>4. Frozen Evaporator Coil</h3>
<p>Caused by restricted airflow or low refrigerant, ice buildup on the coil forces the system to shut down.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Turn off the AC, let it thaw, check the filter, and call for professional service.</p>

<h3>5. Faulty Thermostat</h3>
<p>A malfunctioning thermostat can send incorrect signals to your AC, causing erratic cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check thermostat location (away from direct sunlight/drafts), replace batteries, or upgrade to a modern programmable model.</p>

<h3>6. Electrical Issues</h3>
<p>Loose connections, corroded wires, or a failing compressor can cause intermittent operation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional electrical diagnosis and repair needed.</p>

<h2>What You Can Do Right Now</h2>
<ol>
<li>Check and replace your air filter</li>
<li>Ensure all vents are open and unobstructed</li>
<li>Check the thermostat settings and battery</li>
<li>Clear debris from around the outdoor unit</li>

</ol>
