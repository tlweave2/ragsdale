<h1>Why Is My Home So Dusty All the Time?</h1>

<p>Living in Central Valley, California means dealing with agricultural dust, pollen, and dry conditions—but your home shouldn't feel like a dust bowl! If you're constantly cleaning but dust keeps accumulating, your HVAC system might be the culprit.</p>

<h2>HVAC-Related Causes of Excessive Dust</h2>

<h3>1. Dirty or Low-Quality Air Filter</h3>
<p>Your air filter is the first line of defense against dust. A clogged filter can't trap particles, and cheap fiberglass filters barely work at all.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use MERV 8-13 rated pleated filters and change them monthly during peak seasons (summer heat, spring allergies). Central Valley's dusty environment demands more frequent changes than the standard 3-month recommendation.</p>

<h3>2. Leaky Ductwork</h3>
<p>Unsealed or damaged ducts pull in dust from attics, crawl spaces, and wall cavities, then distribute it throughout your home.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional duct sealing and cleaning. In older Central Valley homes, ductwork often needs attention.</p>

<h3>3. Poor Ventilation</h3>
<p>Without proper air exchange, dust particles have nowhere to go and continuously recirculate.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Upgrade to a whole-home ventilation system or ERV (Energy Recovery Ventilator).</p>

<h3>4. No Air Purification System</h3>
<p>Standard HVAC systems circulate air but don't actively clean it.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Install UV air purifiers or HEPA filtration systems designed for Central Valley's unique air quality challenges.</p>

<h3>5. Dirty Evaporator Coil</h3>
<p>Dust buildup on the indoor coil reduces efficiency and sends particles back into your home.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Annual professional maintenance includes coil cleaning.</p>

<h2>Non-HVAC Factors Contributing to Dust</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Living near agricultural fields, construction, or unpaved roads</li>
<li><strong>Pets:</strong> Dander and fur add to airborne particles</li>
<li><strong>Carpeting:</strong> Traps and releases dust; hard floors are easier to keep clean</li>
<li><strong>Open windows:</strong> Brings in outdoor dust and pollen</li>
<li><strong>Bedding:</strong> Sheets and blankets shed fibers</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Central Valley Dust Challenge</h2>
<p>Our region faces unique air quality challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agricultural operations create seasonal dust</li>
<li>Dry summer heat increases particle circulation</li>
<li>Valley geography traps pollutants</li>
<li>Wildfires add smoke and ash during fire season</li>
</ul>

<p>Your HVAC system works harder here than in most regions, making proper filtration and maintenance even more critical.</p>
