<h1>5 Common Furnace Problems in Central Valley, CA</h1>

<p>While Central Valley winters are milder than many regions, nighttime temperatures can drop below freezing, and foggy mornings demand a reliable heating system. Don't let furnace problems leave you shivering! Here are the most common issues we see and what you can do about them.</p>

<h2>1. Furnace Won't Turn On</h2>
<p><strong>Possible causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thermostat set too low or in wrong mode</li>
<li>Tripped circuit breaker</li>
<li>Furnace switch accidentally turned off</li>
<li>Dead thermostat batteries</li>
<li>Clogged air filter causing safety shutdown</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to check:</strong> Thermostat settings, circuit breaker, furnace power switch (looks like a light switch near the unit), and air filter.</p>
<p><strong>When to call us:</strong> If basic checks don't solve it, you may have ignition problems, a failed control board, or gas valve issues.</p>

<h2>2. Furnace Runs But No Heat</h2>
<p><strong>Common causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot light out (older furnaces)</li>
<li>Ignitor failure (newer furnaces)</li>
<li>Thermostat malfunction</li>
<li>Gas supply interrupted</li>
<li>Flame sensor needs cleaning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DIY check:</strong> Make sure other gas appliances work (stove, water heater). If they don't, it's a gas supply issue—call your gas company.</p>
<p><strong>Professional service needed for:</strong> Pilot light/ignitor problems require technical expertise and safety precautions.</p>

<h2>3. Strange Noises From Furnace</h2>
<p><strong>Banging/Popping:</strong> Delayed ignition (gas builds up then ignites suddenly). This is dangerous and requires immediate professional service.</p>
<p><strong>Squealing/Screeching:</strong> Worn blower motor bearings or loose belt. Needs lubrication or replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Rumbling:</strong> Burner flame problem or ductwork expansion noises. Have burners cleaned and inspected.</p>
<p><strong>Clicking:</strong> Normal if it's just when starting/stopping. Continuous clicking indicates ignition problems.</p>

<h2>4. Furnace Cycles On and Off Frequently</h2>
<p><strong>Short cycling causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dirty air filter (most common)</li>
<li>Oversized furnace for your home</li>
<li>Malfunctioning thermostat</li>
<li>Blocked vents reducing airflow</li>
<li>Flame sensor issue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased wear, higher energy bills, uneven heating, reduced lifespan.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Start with a new filter. If problem persists, call for professional diagnosis.</p>

<h2>5. Yellow Pilot Light (Instead of Blue)</h2>
<p><strong>⚠️ SAFETY WARNING:</strong> A yellow or orange flame indicates incomplete combustion and possible carbon monoxide production.</p>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> Dirty burners, ventilation problems, or gas pressure issues.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Turn off the furnace immediately and call for professional service. Do not attempt DIY repairs. Consider installing carbon monoxide detectors throughout your home.</p>

<h2>Central Valley Heating Challenges</h2>
<p>Our unique climate creates specific HVAC challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrequent use:</strong> Furnaces sit idle for months, leading to dust buildup and stuck components</li>
<li><strong>Tule fog:</strong> High humidity can affect electrical components</li>
<li><strong>Temperature swings:</strong> 30°F mornings to 70°F afternoons stress systems</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural dust:</strong> Filters clog faster than national averages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintenance Prevents Most Problems</h2>
<p>Annual furnace tune-ups before winter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burner cleaning and inspection</li>
<li>Ignition system testing</li>
<li>Heat exchanger inspection for cracks (carbon monoxide risk)</li>
<li>Blower motor lubrication</li>
<li>Thermostat calibration</li>
<li>Safety controls testing</li>
<li>Gas pressure verification</li>
<li>Carbon monoxide testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Replace vs. Repair</h2>
<p><strong>Consider replacement if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Furnace is 15+ years old</li>
<li>Repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost</li>
<li>Frequent repairs needed</li>
<li>Rising energy bills despite normal usage</li>
<li>Uneven heating throughout home</li>
<li>Yellow pilot light or cracked heat exchanger</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern high-efficiency furnaces can reduce heating costs by 30-40% and include better safety features.</p>
