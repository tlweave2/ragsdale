<!-- AC CYCLING GUIDE -->
<div class="guide-section" id="ac-cycling">
    <h2>Why Does My Air Conditioner Keep Turning On and Off?</h2>

    <p>If your air conditioner is short cycling (turning on and off frequently), it's not just annoying—it can lead to higher energy bills, reduced comfort, and expensive repairs. This common problem has several causes, and understanding them can help you know when to call for professional help.</p>

    <h3>Common Causes of AC Short Cycling</h3>

    <h4>1. Dirty Air Filter</h4>
    <p>The most common and easily fixable cause. A clogged filter restricts airflow, causing the system to overheat and shut down. In Central Valley's dusty climate, filters need checking monthly.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace or clean your filter every 1-3 months.</p>

    <h4>2. Refrigerant Leak</h4>
    <p>Low refrigerant levels cause pressure imbalances that trigger safety switches, shutting the system down prematurely.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> This requires professional repair—refrigerant leaks must be fixed and recharged by licensed technicians.</p>

    <h4>3. Oversized AC Unit</h4>
    <p>An air conditioner that's too large for your home cools too quickly and shuts off before completing a full cycle, never properly dehumidifying your home.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> May require replacing with a properly sized system.</p>

    <h4>4. Frozen Evaporator Coil</h4>
    <p>Caused by restricted airflow or low refrigerant, ice buildup on the coil forces the system to shut down.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Turn off the AC, let it thaw, check the filter, and call for professional service.</p>

    <h4>5. Faulty Thermostat</h4>
    <p>A malfunctioning thermostat can send incorrect signals to your AC, causing erratic cycling.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check thermostat location (away from direct sunlight/drafts), replace batteries, or upgrade to a modern programmable model.</p>

    <h4>6. Electrical Issues</h4>
    <p>Loose connections, corroded wires, or a failing compressor can cause intermittent operation.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional electrical diagnosis and repair needed.</p>

    <h3>What You Can Do Right Now</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Check and replace your air filter</li>
        <li>Ensure all vents are open and unobstructed</li>
        <li>Check the thermostat settings and battery</li>
        <li>Clear debris from around the outdoor unit</li>
        <li>Listen for unusual sounds when the AC cycles</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>When to Call for Help</h3>
        <p>If basic troubleshooting doesn't solve the problem, or if you notice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ice on refrigerant lines or evaporator coil</li>
            <li>Unusual sounds (grinding, squealing, banging)</li>
            <li>Burning smells</li>
            <li>Tripped circuit breakers</li>
            <li>Rising energy bills despite normal usage</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Don't wait—short cycling puts extra strain on your system and can lead to complete failure.</strong></p>

<!-- DUSTY HOME GUIDE -->
<div class="guide-section" id="dusty-home">
    <h2>Why Is My Home So Dusty All the Time?</h2>

    <p>Living in Central Valley, California means dealing with agricultural dust, pollen, and dry conditions—but your home shouldn't feel like a dust bowl! If you're constantly cleaning but dust keeps accumulating, your HVAC system might be the culprit.</p>

    <h3>HVAC-Related Causes of Excessive Dust</h3>

    <h4>1. Dirty or Low-Quality Air Filter</h4>
    <p>Your air filter is the first line of defense against dust. A clogged filter can't trap particles, and cheap fiberglass filters barely work at all.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use MERV 8-13 rated pleated filters and change them monthly during peak seasons (summer heat, spring allergies). Central Valley's dusty environment demands more frequent changes than the standard 3-month recommendation.</p>

    <h4>2. Leaky Ductwork</h4>
    <p>Unsealed or damaged ducts pull in dust from attics, crawl spaces, and wall cavities, then distribute it throughout your home.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional duct sealing and cleaning. In older Central Valley homes, ductwork often needs attention.</p>

    <h4>3. Poor Ventilation</h4>
    <p>Without proper air exchange, dust particles have nowhere to go and continuously recirculate.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Upgrade to a whole-home ventilation system or ERV (Energy Recovery Ventilator).</p>

    <h4>4. No Air Purification System</h4>
    <p>Standard HVAC systems circulate air but don't actively clean it.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Install UV air purifiers or HEPA filtration systems designed for Central Valley's unique air quality challenges.</p>

    <h4>5. Dirty Evaporator Coil</h4>
    <p>Dust buildup on the indoor coil reduces efficiency and sends particles back into your home.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Annual professional maintenance includes coil cleaning.</p>

    <h3>Non-HVAC Factors Contributing to Dust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Living near agricultural fields, construction, or unpaved roads</li>
        <li><strong>Pets:</strong> Dander and fur add to airborne particles</li>
        <li><strong>Carpeting:</strong> Traps and releases dust; hard floors are easier to keep clean</li>
        <li><strong>Open windows:</strong> Brings in outdoor dust and pollen</li>
        <li><strong>Bedding:</strong> Sheets and blankets shed fibers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Central Valley Dust Challenge</h3>
    <p>Our region faces unique air quality challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agricultural operations create seasonal dust</li>
        <li>Dry summer heat increases particle circulation</li>
        <li>Valley geography traps pollutants</li>
        <li>Wildfires add smoke and ash during fire season</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>Quick Fixes You Can Try Today</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Replace your air filter with a higher MERV rating</li>
            <li>Vacuum vents and returns</li>

<!-- CIRCUIT BREAKER GUIDE -->
<div class="guide-section" id="circuit-breaker">
    <h2>6 Reasons Your Air Conditioner Keeps Tripping the Circuit Breaker</h2>

    <p>When your AC trips the circuit breaker repeatedly, it's more than an inconvenience—it's a warning sign. During Central Valley's hot summers, a non-functioning air conditioner isn't just uncomfortable, it can be dangerous. Here's what might be causing the problem and what you should do about it.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Basics</h3>
    <p>Circuit breakers are safety devices that cut power when electrical current exceeds safe levels. When your AC trips the breaker, it means the system is drawing too much power or there's an electrical fault. This protects your home from electrical fires and equipment damage.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Important Safety Note:</strong> If your breaker trips repeatedly (more than once), don't keep resetting it. This indicates a serious problem that needs professional diagnosis.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Common Causes</h3>

    <h4>1. Dirty Air Filter</h4>
    <p><strong>How it happens:</strong> A clogged filter restricts airflow, forcing the blower motor to work harder and draw more current. In Central Valley's dusty conditions, this happens faster than in other regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Weak airflow, warm air from vents, breaker trips after running for a while</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace the filter immediately. If the breaker still trips with a clean filter, call for service.</p>

    <h4>2. Dirty Condenser Coils</h4>
    <p><strong>How it happens:</strong> Dust, cottonwood, and debris on the outdoor unit's coils reduce heat transfer efficiency, causing the compressor to overwork and overheat.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Visible dirt/debris on outdoor unit, warm air coming from vents, system shuts down during hottest part of day</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Gently clean the outdoor unit with a garden hose (power off first). Annual professional cleaning prevents this issue.</p>

    <h4>3. Failing Compressor</h4>
    <p><strong>How it happens:</strong> The compressor is your AC's heart. When it wears out, it draws excessive current trying to start or run, immediately tripping the breaker.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Loud humming or buzzing before breaker trips, hard starting, age of system (10+ years)</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional diagnosis required. May need compressor replacement or full system replacement depending on age and cost.</p>

    <h4>4. Capacitor Problems</h4>
    <p><strong>How it happens:</strong> Capacitors help motors start and run efficiently. When they fail, motors struggle and draw extra current. Central Valley heat accelerates capacitor wear.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Clicking sounds, compressor won't start, breaker trips when trying to start</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Capacitor replacement by a professional (contains stored electrical charge—dangerous for DIY).</p>

    <h4>5. Refrigerant Leaks</h4>
    <p><strong>How it happens:</strong> Low refrigerant causes pressure imbalances, making the compressor work harder and overheat, drawing excessive current.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Ice on refrigerant lines, warm air from vents, hissing sounds, higher electric bills</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional leak repair and refrigerant recharge. Simply adding refrigerant without fixing the leak wastes money and harms the environment.</p>

    <h4>6. Electrical Issues</h4>
    <p><strong>How it happens:</strong> Loose connections, corroded wiring, or a breaker that's too small for your AC can all cause tripping.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> Burning smell, melted insulation near breaker box, breaker feels hot, trips immediately upon power on</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Immediate professional service required. Electrical problems can cause fires.</p>

    <h3>What NOT to Do</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>❌ Don't replace the breaker with a higher amp rating without professional consultation</li>
        <li>❌ Don't ignore repeated tripping—this is a fire hazard</li>
        <li>❌ Don't use extension cords or power strips for AC units</li>
        <li>❌ Don't attempt electrical repairs yourself unless you're a licensed electrician</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>Prevention Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Schedule annual maintenance before summer</li>
            <li>Change filters monthly during cooling season</li>
            <li>Keep outdoor unit clean and clear of debris</li>

<!-- ENERGY SAVING GUIDE -->
<div class="guide-section" id="energy-saving">
    <h2>Energy Saving Tips for Central Valley Homeowners</h2>

    <p>Central Valley summers are brutal on air conditioners and energy bills. With temperatures regularly exceeding 100°F from June through September, cooling costs can skyrocket. Here are proven strategies to keep your home comfortable without breaking the bank.</p>

    <h3>HVAC System Optimization</h3>

    <h4>1. Set Your Thermostat Wisely</h4>
    <p><strong>Summer:</strong> Set to 78°F when home, 85°F when away. Every degree below 78°F increases cooling costs by 3-5%.</p>
    <p><strong>Winter:</strong> Set to 68°F when home, 62°F when sleeping or away.</p>
    <p><strong>Upgrade tip:</strong> Programmable thermostats save 10-30% on energy costs by automatically adjusting temperatures based on your schedule.</p>

    <h4>2. Change Filters Religiously</h4>
    <p>In Central Valley's dusty climate, dirty filters are the #1 cause of high energy bills.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Standard filters:</strong> Change monthly during peak seasons (June-September, December-February)</li>
        <li><strong>High-efficiency filters:</strong> Check monthly, change when dirty</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> A dirty filter can increase energy use by 15%</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Schedule Annual Maintenance</h4>
    <p>Professional tune-ups improve efficiency by 5-15%:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean coils transfer heat better</li>
        <li>Proper refrigerant levels prevent overworking</li>
        <li>Lubricated motors use less energy</li>
        <li>Calibrated thermostats prevent overcooling</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>ROI:</strong> $100-150 tune-up typically saves $200-400 per year in energy costs.</p>

    <h4>4. Use Ceiling Fans Correctly</h4>
    <p><strong>Summer:</strong> Counter-clockwise to push air down, allowing you to raise thermostat 4°F without sacrificing comfort</p>
    <p><strong>Winter:</strong> Clockwise on low to push warm air down from ceiling</p>
    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Fans cool people, not rooms—turn them off in empty rooms</p>

    <h4>5. Seal Ductwork</h4>
    <p>Typical Central Valley homes lose 20-30% of cooled/heated air through duct leaks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check attic ducts for disconnections and gaps</li>
        <li>Professional duct sealing pays for itself in 2-3 years</li>
        <li>Focus on attic ducts first—that's where most leakage occurs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Home Weatherization for Central Valley Climate</h3>

    <h4>6. Maximize Attic Insulation</h4>
    <p>Central Valley attics can reach 140-160°F in summer! Proper insulation is critical.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> R-38 to R-49 for Central Valley homes</li>
        <li><strong>Also important:</strong> Attic ventilation to reduce heat buildup</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Radiant barriers can reduce attic temps by 30°F</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Window Treatments</h4>
    <p>Windows account for 25-30% of cooling costs in summer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Close blinds/curtains on south and west windows during afternoon</li>
        <li>Use reflective window film or solar screens</li>
        <li>Consider upgrading to dual-pane, low-E windows if budget allows</li>
        <li>Plant shade trees on west side (takes 5-10 years but provides long-term savings)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Seal Air Leaks</h4>
    <p>Focus on these high-impact areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attic access doors and hatches</li>
        <li>Recessed lighting fixtures</li>
        <li>Plumbing and electrical penetrations</li>
        <li>Window and door frames</li>
        <li>Fireplace dampers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Smart Usage Habits</h3>

    <h4>9. Strategic Appliance Use</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Run dishwasher, washer, and dryer during evening/morning when it's cooler</li>
        <li>Use lids on pots to reduce cooking heat</li>
        <li>Grill outside instead of using oven in summer</li>
        <li>Take advantage of PG&E's time-of-use rates if available</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>10. Manage Humidity</h4>
    <p>Dehumidification uses less energy than cooling:</p>

    <h3>When to Consider System Upgrades</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>SEER ratings:</strong> Look for 16+ SEER for AC units</li>
        <li><strong>AFUE ratings:</strong> 95%+ AFUE for furnaces</li>
        <li><strong>Variable speed:</strong> More efficient than single-speed systems</li>
        <li><strong>Smart thermostats:</strong> Learn your patterns and optimize automatically</li>
